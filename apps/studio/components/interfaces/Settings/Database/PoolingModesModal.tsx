Each pooling mode handles connections differently.

### Transaction mode
This mode is recommended if you are connecting from *serverless environments*. A connection is assigned to the client for the duration of a transaction. Two consecutive transactions from the same client could be executed over two different connections. Some session-based Postgres features such as prepared statements are *not available* with this option.

### Session mode
This mode is similar to connecting to your database directly. There is full support for prepared statements in this mode. When a new client connects, a connection is assigned to the client until it disconnects. You *might run into pooler connection limits* since the connection is held till the client disconnects.

### Using session and transaction modes at the same time
 ${
     'To get the best of both worlds, as a starting point, we recommend using session mode just when you need support for prepared statements and transaction mode in other cases.'
